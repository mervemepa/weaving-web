  <div id="main"></div>
  <p class="paragraph">The project 'anonymousText.tie' is the output of a critical investigation on potentials of
    integrating traditional
    weaving techniques with social and technical developments that led to current gender situations.
  
    Just as the technological development itself can be perceived as a "feminization" of culture that will lead to an
    increasing dissolution of gender, the art of weaving can also lead to a subversion of gender roles. For this reason
    for centuries,
    weavers have employed a customized textual weaving algorithm, called ‘name drafting’, to encode their personal stories
    and experiences on rugs and textiles. Here at the middle draft displays the weaving pattern with the logic of punch
    cards that
    generates the name drafting algorithm by your personal words or sentences on threads and pedals.
  
    The project attempts to archive daily or periodic concerns and situations, as women do through history by weaving, and
    reverse it through today’s communication tools. This approach not only empowers expression itself through new forms of
    storytelling, but also contributes to a larger discourse on gender equality and social justice, ultimately creating
    new
    possibilities for the future...</p>
