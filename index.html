    <div class="info">Weaving with Text - Version 1.0.1</div>
    <p class="paragraph_0">TextDraft / Weaving with Text proposes to think together about the traditional fields of weaving
      and language to
      reveal alternative possibilities. It explores the transformation and preservation of memory and recording, imagining a
      symbiotic
      relationship between language and weaving systems. The project focuses on the role of weaving as a socio-cultural
      repository of memory and the metamorphosis of language created through weaving, especially by women throughout
      history.</p>
    <p class="paragraph_0">The core of this research is based on a centuries-old weaving algorithm called "name drafting".
      This algorithm uses letters as the threads that orchestrate the weaving process itself.The letters are coded as
      threads.
      They intertwine within the structure of the weave and form the design draft.</p>
    <p class="paragraph_0">The top column of the screen represents the threads and the side column represents the loom
      pedals.
      As the user types in the text box, the characters are coded to the threads and pedals using the appropriate algorithm.
      When the 'Weave Text'
      command is activated, the weave in the center sketch is created by combining the user input with the available
      threads.
      And the 'tie-up', located in the top right-hand corner, acts as an elemental blueprint that can be modified using the
      'Change Tie-up' functionality.</p>

    <p class="paragraph_0">Beyond its technical facets, the project considers the transformative potential of weaving in the
      realm of gender roles.
      In line with technological advances catalysing cultural change, the art of weaving is explored as a conduit for
      analogous social change. The project proposes an avenue for amplifying narratives and discourses of gender equality
      and
      social justice.</p>
