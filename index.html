    <p class="paragraph_0">The TextDraft / Weaving with Text brings together the fields of traditional weaving and language to open new
    possibilities. It explores the transformation and preservation of memory and recording, imagining a symbiotic
    relationship between language and weaving systems. The research focuses on the role of weaving as a socio-cultural
    repository of memory and the metamorphosis of language created through weaving, especially by women throughout history.</p>
    <p class="paragraph_0">At the heart of the initiative is the innovative "name draft" weaving algorithm. This algorithm uses letters as the
    basic threads that orchestrate the weaving process itself. Letters, encoded as threads, intertwine within the weave
    structure, encapsulating the abstract in tangible form.</p> 
    <p class="paragraph_0">The top column of the screen represents the threads and the side column represents the loom pedals. As the user types in
    the text box, the characters are coded to the threads and pedals using the appropriate algorithm. When the 'Weave Text'
    command is activated, the weave in the central sketch is created by combining the user input with the available threads.
    And the 'weave', located in the top right-hand corner, acts as an elemental blueprint that can be customised using the
    'change weave' functionality.</p> 
    <p class="paragraph_0">Beyond its technical facets, the project considers the transformative potential of weaving in the realm of gender roles.
    In line with technological advances catalysing cultural change, the art of weaving is explored as a conduit for
    analogous social change. The project proposes an avenue for amplifying narratives and discourses of gender equality and
    social justice.</p>
