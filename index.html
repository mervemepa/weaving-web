    <div class="info">Weaving with Text - Version 1.0.1</div>
    <p class="paragraph_0">TextDraft / Weaving with Text proposes to think together about the traditional fields of weaving
      and language to
      reveal alternative possibilities. It explores the transformation and preservation of memory and recording, imagining a
      symbiotic
      relationship between language and weaving systems. The project focuses on the role of weaving as a socio-cultural
      repository of memory and the metamorphosis of language created through weaving, especially by women throughout
      history.</p>
    <p class="paragraph_0">Just as the technological development itself can be perceived as a "feminization" of culture that will lead to an
    increasing dissolution of gender, the art of weaving can also lead to a subversion of gender roles. For centuries,
    weavers have employed a customized textual weaving algorithm, called ‘name drafting’, to encode their personal stories
    and experiences on rugs and textiles.The core of this research is based on this centuries-old weaving algorithm.
      This algorithm uses letters as the threads that orchestrate the weaving process itself.The letters are coded as
      threads. 
      They intertwine within the structure of the weave and form the design draft.</p>
    <p class="paragraph_0">The top column of the screen represents the threads and the side column represents the loom
      pedals.
      As the user types in the text box, the characters are coded to the threads and pedals using the appropriate algorithm.
      When the 'Weave Text'
      command is activated, the weave in the center sketch is created by combining the user input with the available
      threads.
      And the 'tie-up', located in the top right-hand corner, acts as an elemental blueprint that can be modified using the
      'Change Tie-up' functionality.</p>

    <p class="paragraph_0">Beyond its technical facets, the project considers the transformative potential of weaving in the
      realm of gender roles. The project attempts to archive daily or periodic concerns and situations, as women do through history by weaving, and
      reverse it through today’s communication tools. This approach not only empowers expression itself through new forms of
      storytelling, but also contributes to a larger discourse on gender equality and social justice, ultimately creating new
      possibilities for the future.
      In line with technological advances catalysing cultural change, the art of weaving is explored as a conduit for
      analogous social change. The project proposes an avenue for amplifying narratives and discourses of gender equality
      and
      social justice.</p>
      <p class="paragraph_0">Weaving has played a crucial role in connecting women with technology throughout history. Across numerous cultures, it
      was regarded as a female-dominated craft, which was essential in disseminating and documenting information, along with
      the production of textiles.
      The contribution of women in weaving is akin to the pivotal role played by machines and tools in contemporary times.
      With modern communication tools, the issues of visibility and invisibility have evolved, thereby altering the nature of
      expression and the accompanying risks.This project considers the impacts of political and social contexts on gender
      issues all around the world.</p>

      <p class="paragraph_0">To address these challenges, the project seeks to examine the intersection of digital language and traditional weaving
      techniques, creating new means of expressing and documenting politics in the context of freedom of expression.</p>
