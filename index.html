    <p class="paragraph_0">For centuries, weavers have employed a customized <span>textual weaving</span> algorithm, called <span>‘name drafting’</span>, to encode their <span>personal stories
    and experiences</span> on rugs and textiles. The core of this piece is based on this centuries-old weaving algorithm. As the 
    user types in the text box, the characters are coded to the threads and pedals using the appropriate algorithm.
    This algorithm uses letters as the threads that generate the weaving process itself. Each letter of the alphabet is
    encoded according to the threads that run through the shafts. They intertwine within the structure of the weave to form
    the design.</p>

    <!-- Draft table with Alphabet -->
    <img src="./images/draft_table.svg" style="display: flex; max-width: 100%;">

    <p class="paragraph_0">The top column of the draft represents the threads that run through the shafts and the side column
    represents the pedals. As the user types in the text box, the characters are coded simultaneously to the threads and
    pedals using the appropriate algorithm. When the 'weave your text' command is enabled, the 'woven text draft' in the center of 
    the sketch is generated by the user's text input. Or, you can use the <span>'word index'</span> button to create your weaving draft from a preset word. The 'tie-up' in the top right corner of the sketch is the smallest 
    pattern unit that makes up the weave. And each time the 'change tie-up' button is pressed, a new variation of your text weave is generated.
    Here you can see the physical weaving outputs created with two separate text inputs:</p>

    <p class="paragraph_0">TextDraft/Weaving with Text proposes thinking about the fields of weaving and language together to reveal alternate
    possibilities. It explores the transformation and preservation of memory and recording, imagining a
    symbiotic relationship between language and weaving systems. The project focuses on the role of weaving as a
    socio-cultural repository of memory and the metamorphosis of language created through weaving, especially by women
    throughout history.</p>

        <p class="paragraph_0">Through <span>language</span>, people develop logical processes of <span>quantification</span>, <span>measurement and modeling</span>
          to understand and
          explain socio-cultural and historical contexts. Just as the technological development itself can be perceived as a <span>"feminization"</span> 
          of culture that will lead to an increasing <span>dissolution of gender</span>, the art of weaving can also lead to a subversion of gender roles. 
          It is well known that women, in particular, create <span>cultural memory</span> by disseminating these models (such as weaving) within their own 
          communication networks, mostly verbally, sometimes in written and drawn form within and between households. These tools are used to 
          discover <span>relationships, patterns and regularities</span> by schematising, formulating and visualizing a problem in different ways. By translating the reality of
          the world into mathematical ideas, they have <span>recorded</span> concepts, situations and practices. Cultural politics is therefore
          closely related to ethno-technics. Such diversity of local and cultural knowledge can therefore also contribute to
          'technological diversity' in a world moving towards <span>'technological singularity'</span>.To address these challenges, this
          project aims to examine the <span>intersection of digital language</span> and traditional weaving techniques and create new ways of expressing and 
          <span>documenting politics</span> in the context of <span>discourse and the recording of memory</span>.</p>

          <!-- Ethno-computing diagram-->
          <img src="./images/cells.svg" style="display: block; max-width: 100%;">

      <p class="paragraph_0"><span>Weaving has</span> <span>played a crucial role</span> <span>in connecting women</span> <span>with technology</span> <span>throughout history</span>. <span>Across</span> <span>numerous cultures</span>, it
      was <span>regarded as</span> <span>a female-dominated craft,</span>which was essential <span>in disseminating</span> <span> and documenting information</span>   , <span>along with</span>
      <span>the production of textiles.</span>
      The contribution of women in weaving is akin to the pivotal role played by <span>machines</span> and <span>tools</span> in contemporary times.
      With modern <span>communication</span> tools, the issues of <span>visibility</span> and <span>invisibility</span> have evolved, thereby altering the nature of
      <span>expression</span> and the accompanying <span>risks</span>.</p>


        <p class="paragraph_0">TEXTDRAFT considers the <span>transformative</span> potential of weaving in the
          realm of <span>gender roles</span>. The project aims to <span>archive</span> daily or periodic <span>concerns</span> and <span>situations</span>, as women do through
          history by weaving, and <span>reverse</span> it through today’s communication <span>tools</span>. This approach not only empowers expression itself through <span>new forms</span> of
          <span>storytelling</span>, but also contributes to a larger discourse on gender <span>equality and social justice</span>, ultimately creating
          new <span>possibilities</span>.
          In line with technological advances <span>catalyzing</span> cultural change, the art of weaving is explored as a conduit for
          analogous social change. The project proposes an avenue for amplifying <span>narrative and discourse</span> of gender equality
          and <span>social justice</span>.</p>
