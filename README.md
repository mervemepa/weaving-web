# TextDraft

### Short Project Summary

TextDraft / Weaving with Text proposes to think together the traditional fields of weaving and language to reveal alternative possibilities. It explores the transformation and preservation of memory and recording, imagining a symbiotic relationship between language and weaving systems. The project focuses on the role of weaving as a socio-cultural repository of memory and the metamorphosis of language created through weaving, especially by women throughout history.

### Description of the Project:

The core of this research is based on a centuries-old weaving algorithm called "name drafting". This algorithm uses letters as the basic threads that orchestrate the weaving process itself. Letters, encoded as threads, intertwine within the weave structure, encapsulating the abstract in tangible form.
The top column of the screen represents the threads and the side column represents the loom pedals. As the user types in the text box, the characters are coded to the threads and pedals using the appropriate algorithm. When the 'Weave Text' command is activated, the weave in the central sketch is created by combining the user input with the available threads. And the 'tie-up', located in the top right-hand corner, acts as an elemental blueprint that can be customised using the 'change tie-up' functionality.

### Political and Social Context

The project considers the impacts of political and social contexts on personal gender situations worldwide but particularly in Turkey. With the rise of social media and communication tools, issues of visibility and invisibility have evolved, shifting the nature of expression and the associated risks. To address these challenges, the project seeks to examine the intersection of digital language and traditional weaving techniques, creating new means of expressing and documenting politics in the context of freedom of expression.

Weaving can be seen as an example of the connection between women and technology throughout history. In many cultures, weaving was traditionally a female activity and was essential for the reproduction of textiles. This role of women in weaving can be compared to the role of machines and tools in modern times. The correlation is being based on the fact that from the beginnings in a male dominated culture „women have always been the machine parts “being„ the means of reproducing the species, reproducing communications which is obviously similar to the role of machines and tools.

These kinds of alternations— _something woven something unwoven, something computed something uncomputed, a story told a story left untold_—pervade the history of texts and textiles, just as they punctuate the history of computers and cybernetics.
